  <h2>Styleguide docs</h2>
  <p>Unlike other front-end toolkits, Bootstrap was designed first and foremost as a styleguide to document not only our features, but best practices and living, coded examples.</p>

  <h2>Custom jQuery plugins</h2>
  <p>What good is an awesome design component without easy-to-use, proper, and extensible interactions? With Bootstrap, you get custom-built jQuery plugins to bring your projects to life.</p>
